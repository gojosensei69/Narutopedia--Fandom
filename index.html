<h1><font size =5>1.Origins: </h1></font><font size=5>The Akatsuki was originally formed by Yahiko, Konan, and Nagato (who later becomes known as Pain) in an attempt to bring peace to their war-torn homeland, the Hidden Rain Village (Amegakure). After Yahiko's death, Nagato assumed leadership.</font>
<h1><font size =5>2.Members: </h1></font><font size=5>The Akatsuki is composed of powerful rogue ninja who have defected from their respective villages. Each member is highly skilled and has unique abilities. Some notable members include Itachi Uchiha, Kisame Hoshigaki, Deidara, Sasori, and others.</font>
<h1><font size =5>3.Goals: </h1></font><font size=5>The original goal of the Akatsuki was to achieve peace by eliminating the leaders of the major ninja villages, which they believed would end the constant wars. However, under Nagato's leadership, the organization's goals shifted to using fear and force to impose their version of peace on the world.</font>
<h1><font size =5>4.Capture of Tailed Beasts: </h1></font><font size=5>One of the major objectives of the Akatsuki is to capture the Tailed Beasts (Bijuu) and extract them from their hosts. These powerful creatures, also known as Jinchuriki, are beings with immense chakra and unique abilities.
<h1><font size =5>5.Final Battle:</h1></font><font size=5>The conflict with the Akatsuki culminates in a series of intense battles, leading to a final confrontation between Naruto and Sasuke against the remaining members of the organization, including Nagato and Obito Uchiha.</font>

<font size=5>Itachi Uchiha (うちはイタチ, Uchiha Itachi) was a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan who served as an Anbu Captain. <br>He later became an international criminal after murdering his entire clan, sparing only his younger brother, Sasuke.</br>  <br>He afterwards joined the international criminal organisation known as Akatsuki, whose activity brought him into frequent conflict with Konoha and its ninja — including Sasuke who sought to avenge their clan by killing Itachi.</br> Following his death, Itachi's motives were revealed to be more complicated than they seemed and that his actions were only ever in the interest of his brother and village, <br>making him remain a loyal shinobi of Konohagakure to the very end.</br></font>
